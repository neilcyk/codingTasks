"""
This script simulates a passwordless login system.
It reads the student's email address and student ID from a file (input2.txt)
and verifies these credentials against a database. If a matching record is
found, the script logs the student into the system by displaying a welcome
message.

TODO:
- Implement login functionality without requiring the Student ID.
- Retrieve the details of the student with the email address

To log into your profile, simply enter into input2.txt the following details:

If you know your student ID, you will be logged into the system.
For an example, please look at input2_example.txt.
