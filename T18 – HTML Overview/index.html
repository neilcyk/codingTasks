    <p><strong>Cycling</strong> was an adventure every time. I would explore new streets and feel the thrill of the open road. One day, I rode too fast down a hill and fell, but I got back up and kept going.</p>

    <h2><em>TV Game</em></h2>

    <p><strong>Remote Control Car</strong> was my pride and joy. I would race it around the house and create obstacle courses. I remember getting my first high-speed RC car and feeling amazed at how fast it could go.</p>
