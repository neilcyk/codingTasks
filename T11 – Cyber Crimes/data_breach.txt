*What do you think the risk is for individuals when their email addresses and passwords are exposed to the public?
The risk of digital crime increases when my exposed email address is exploited as a tool for malicious activity. It could be included in a vast database used for mass phishing campaigns, serving as a delivery point for deceptive emails. Alternatively, I might be targeted as a victim, receiving fake emails that appear to come from trusted service providers. To mitigate these risks, I must remain vigilant, carefully monitoring my inbox for suspicious emails and avoiding opening attachments from unsolicited messages. 
A disclosed password could be stored in a database and used to attempt unauthorized access to services protected by that password. Additionally, the exposed password might serve as the basis for generating similar variations, increasing the likelihood of successful attacks using related patterns.


*Name two actions you can take to protect yourself against the risks associated with data breaches
Changing your password is the first essential step. Adopt a strong password that combines special characters, uppercase and lowercase letters. A strong password is typically created by connecting three or more words and mixing them with symbols and varying cases. Avoid using the same or similar passwords across multiple accounts. Regularly update your passwords or follow reminders to change them as necessary. Never share your password with anyone, even those close to you. Whenever possible, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA). This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a one-time passcode (OTP) sent to your phone to complete the login process.
