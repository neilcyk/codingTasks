*Application of skills:
With the growing demand for cybersecurity solutions among small and medium-sized enterprises, targeting this sector could be an excellent starting point to apply the skills gained from the bootcamp. These businesses increasingly require cybersecurity solutions and advice from professionals like us. For instance, as a Potential Driving Instructor franchisee in Road Rule Driving School — a traditional family business offering driving lessons across Greater London — I have observed significant opportunities for improvement.
 
After speaking with the founder of the school, I noticed their website is basic and outdated, with notable vulnerabilities in its web application. There are numerous opportunities to enhance the site and introduce modern online services, such as a driving test booking system, inquiry requests, or a chatbot to handle visitor inquiries. Alongside these features, implementing a robust level of cybersecurity protection would safeguard the website from hacking attempts or overloading issues.

This situation is not unique; many similar competitors' websites face the same challenges, providing ample opportunities to offer comparable services or advice for their website enhancement. Furthermore, I recognize the potential for creating a long-term project by focusing on the driving learner's lifecycle. For example, developing a system to track a learner's journey from the moment they enroll in the driving course, monitor their learning progress, and manage their booking records with driving instructors within the school.

Such a system would represent a valuable digital transformation opportunity for the industry, creating an enhanced product tailored to driving schools. In conclusion, there is significant potential to modernize and transform the driving school industry through innovative digital solutions and improved cybersecurity practices.

*Building on existing experience
As a current PDI (Potential Driving Instructor) employed under a driving school franchise, I have the opportunity to gain valuable experience and build connections within the industry. This role allows me to develop a deeper understanding of how this long-standing business operates, enhancing both my skills and knowledge.

Being an insider in the business provides a unique advantage in fostering trust with the founder and presenting new ideas. This position makes it easier to communicate and negotiate how innovative strategies could bring tangible benefits to the business, ensuring its growth and continued success.
