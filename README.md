# README

○ The coding task name.
○ A clear, short, and to-the-point **DESCRIPTON** of your coding task. Describe what it does, and why learning this aspect of coding is important.

○ A **TABLE OF CONTENTS** to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.

○ If anything needs to be installed to run your code, include an **INSTALLATION** section that tells other users how to install your project locally.

○ A **USAGE** section must be included that instructs others on how to use your code after they’ve installed it. Include screenshots of what your program does.

○ A section for **CREDITS** that highlights and links to the authors of your code (in this case it should only be you, but this is good practice for a professional role where you are likely to work in a team of developers)
